# Our Project
Climate change is one of the top social issues affecting the future and presenting risks to the quality of life of people around the world. It is something most people do not think about on a daily basis or think their small actions can impact. We wanted to build something that helps people visualize their impact and learn about ways they can make positive changes for a more sustainable climate!

# What it does
MyCarbon allows people to track their daily habits between categories of transportation, waste, recycling, water, and electricity and gain CarbonPoints for the changes they implement that positively impact the climate.
